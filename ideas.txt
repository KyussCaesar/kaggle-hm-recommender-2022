I bet there's probably some people that are "leaders", when they buy something it's a predictor of other people buying it.

# BASELINES:
## `naiive-zero`: assume no-one buys anything.
- wait nvm the MAP will just be zero

## `naiive-basket` assume everyone will just buy the same as what they bought last time.
- LOCF

## `naiive-most-popular` assume everyone will just buy the 12 most popular items.
