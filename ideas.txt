# BASELINES:
## `naiive-zero`: assume no-one buys anything.
- wait nvm the MAP will just be zero

## `naiive-basket` assume everyone will just buy the same as what they bought last time.
- LOCF

## `naiive-most-popular` assume everyone will just buy the 12 most popular items.

# MODELS
## LGBM: good for the categorical stuff

# FEATURES
## time since the last purchase of that customer
if it has been a very long time since last purchase, assume this customer is not coming back

## variety of shopping of that customer
idea being that the behaviour of customers who purchase a wide variety of items is different to those who purchase smaller variety

e.g. number of unique categories of items purchased within the last timeframe
e.g. number of unique items divided by number of unique categories of items purchased within the last timeframe

## number of times customer bought an item in a certain category in the last timeframe
idea being that if a customer only bought items in one category, assume they would continue to only buy items in that category

## cumulative sum of price for that customer
presume a non-linearity, the behaviour of users who have spent a lot already will be different to that of those who have spent little

## sales channel

## mean time between purchases for that customer

## seasonality (day of week, time of year)

definitely, e.g. winter v.s. summer
- although, this is different depending on location!
- identify approx. location of the customer?
  - we have this already, zip code

possibly day of week? maybe Saturday big spending day, Tuesday not so much

## how to get cross-features/cross-interactions?

e.g. purchasing behaviour of some customers may influence later purchasing behaviour of other customers
performance of one product may influence performance of another
products that are substitutes
products that are complements

collaborative filtering to find these?
k-nearest to find these?

## time since last price change of SKU
## percent difference between current price and last price of SKU
## time since first recorded purchase of SKU
## time since last recorded purchase of SKU
## rolling mean of bucket SKU sales volumes, for the timeframe
e.g. 7-day buckets -> sum total sales volume -> 4 week timeframe -> average of bucket values
## rolling mean of bucket SKU category sales volumes, for the timeframe
e.g. 7-day buckets -> sum total sales volume -> 4 week timeframe -> average of bucket values

# ENSEMBLING
## one model per SKU: customer data -> probability of this product being purchased by that customer within the next week
## one model per customer: product data -> probability of this customer purchasing that product within the next week
## one model per SKU category: customer data -> probability of any product in this category being purchased by that customer within the next week
